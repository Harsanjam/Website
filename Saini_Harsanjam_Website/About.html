        <p>I am a grade 11 student who is currently studying at Stephen Lewis Secondary School. My Favourite color is black and my favourite food is pizza. I also enjoy listening to music as it tends to relax me. Some of my hobbies are playing basketball and badminton. I am also heavily involved in extra-curricular activities such as Deca, Robotics & Junior achievment.</p>

           I joined the Lynx Robotics team this year and was responsible for all communication activities such as making brochures, business and thank-you cards. I also contributed majority of my time in building the robot. It was a bit of a learning curve for me and hard to troubleshoot some of the problems. We hope to compete at worlds this year!!

           Junior Achievment is a program for students that encourages them to start their own business. You collaboratively create a product, market it and sell it. After 5 months, the company gets liquidated and the profit is divided between students.

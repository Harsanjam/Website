            I am a grade 11 student who is currently studying at Stephen Lewis Secondary School. My Favourite color is black and my favourite food is pizza. I also enjoy listening to music as it tends to relax me. Some of my hobbies are playing basketball and badminton. I am also heavily involved in extra-curricular activities such as Deca, Robotics & Junior achievment.

            MIT is pioneering new ways of teaching and learning, on our campus and around the world, by inventing and leveraging digital technologies. MITx (opens in new window), the Institute’s portfolio of massively open online courses, offers flexible access to a range of interactive courses developed and taught by instructors from MIT. Another MIT innovation — the MicroMasters (opens in new window) credential — is increasingly recognized by industry leaders hiring new talent. And MIT’s original digital learning option, OpenCourseWare (opens in new window), continues to offer teachers and learners worldwide the materials for more than 2,000 MIT courses, freely available online.
